  🛫 How it Works

  


1. Sign Up

   Travellers create profiles; agents verify identity (KYC).

2.  Post & Match

      Travellers post trip needs; agents send custom plans.

3.  Secure with Escrow

   Traveller picks a plan; payment is held safely in a smart contract.

4. Chat & Confirm
 
    Clarify details via chat or video before finalizing.

5.  Travel & Upload Proof

     raveller enjoys the trip, then submits reviews or proof.
